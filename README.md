1. Project Title / Headline

Heart Disease Analytics: Survival Insights Dashboard
An interactive and visually engaging Power BI dashboard designed to analyze heart disease patient data, explore survival rates across age groups, and identify key medical risk factors influencing survival outcomes.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Heart Disease Survival Insights Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of heart disease data to help medical analysts, healthcare professionals, and researchers uncover trends in patient survival.
It focuses on variables such as age group, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, blood pressure, anaemia, diabetes, and smoking habits — helping users understand the complex interactions that impact patient survival rates.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

Power BI Desktop – Data visualization and report building platform.

Power Query – Used for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning (ETL).

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculating KPIs such as survival rate, average age of survival, and count metrics.

Data Modeling – Established relationships among patient demographics, medical test results, and survival data for cross-filtering.

Excel/CSV Dataset – Used as the data source for patient medical and survival records.

4. Key Insights / Features

📈 Overall Survival Rate: 67.89% with an average survival age of 58.76 years.

🧬 Age-Based Survival Trends: Higher survival in age group 61–70 (75.9%), lowest in 71+ (10.38%).

💉 Medical Indicators: Correlation between serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and survival outcomes.

🚭 Lifestyle Impact: Visualized influence of smoking, anaemia, diabetes, and blood pressure across different age groups.

👨‍⚕️ Interactive Filters: Gender-based analysis (male vs female survival).

🫀 Dynamic KPIs: Track total patients, total survival, and total deaths interactively.

5. Business / Healthcare Insights & Impact

🩺 Clinical Decision Support: Enables healthcare teams to identify high-risk age groups and focus preventive care efforts.

📊 Predictive Trend Analysis: Helps researchers predict survival likelihood based on patient medical data.

💡 Healthcare Optimization: Revealed that elevated serum creatinine and low ejection fraction strongly correlate with lower survival.

👥 Public Health Impact: Provides visual evidence for prioritizing early screening programs for patients above age 60.

🔍 Outcome: Improved understanding of how demographic and clinical factors influence survival rates in heart disease patients.

6. Intended Audience

Medical data analysts, healthcare researchers, hospital management teams, and students interested in data-driven healthcare analytics.
